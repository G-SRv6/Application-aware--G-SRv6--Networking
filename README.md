# Application-aware G-SRv6 Networking

In the IETF 110 Hackathon, we presented our demo for **Application-aware G-SRv6 Networking**.

G-SRv6 achieves more efficient encapsulation for strict TE.

G-SRv6 vs SRv6:

1. Reduce **75%** size of SID list (Transmission Overhead).

2. Reduce **50%+** overhead for interactive control, IoT, or mMTC scenario, in which the length of packets is under **128 bytes**.

3. Bring **55%+** higher forwarding rate.

4. Fully compatible with SRv6, incremental deployment.

5. No new IPv6 address consumption, no new route creation.

Combined with APN6, we achieved fine-grained control based on service requirement :)

Cheers~
